A file is a string on the hard drive. When you access a file, you access it as a stream.

A stream is a linked list of characters. Because it's a linked list, you access the characters sequentially.

tr is a program that takes two arguments, a string of characters to replace, and a string
    of characters to replace them with

grep is a program that prints each line of its standard input, if it contains the
    characters in its arguments

A programming language is a way for you to tell the computer what to do.
Every programming language has to give you two things:
  1. Represent data (eg our nil/numbers/string/array/hashes)
  2. Maniputlate that data (eg methods)
